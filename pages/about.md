I'm Srijan R. Shetty, a senior undergraduate at the <a href="http://cse.iitk.ac.in">Department of Computer
Science and Engineering</a>,<a href="http://iitk.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur</a>. I'm humbled
that you consider my introduction worthy of your valuable time.<br/><br/>
I'm an eccentric who likes to <a href="#">scribble</a> and <a href="https://github.com/srijanshety">hack on</a> things
(note the 'on'). I like writing poems, the occasional <a href="https://srijanshetty.quora.com/Open-letter-to-the-Senators">
open letters in the wild</a> and public rants.<br/><br/>
I was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=464046796623&set=t.100000238480290&type=3&theater">fat</a>
, I'm <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=446458752038737&set=a.152928964725052.29764.100000238480290&type=1&theater">not-so-fat now</a>. I managed to crack (sic) IITJEE, and they replaced it with JEE Mains the next year. To the surprise of all the aunties of my neighbourhood, I chose Kanpur over Bombay.
(<a href="https://srijanshetty.quora.com/Why-IIT-Kanpur">best-decision-of-my-life</a>).
I became a peace crusader in college as a member of the <a href="http://antaragni.org">Antaragni</a> peace corps.
Ever since then, I try to talk in third person and paint a larger than life picture of myself. <br/><br/>
I fancy myself as a Pan-Indian. My parents are from the South, this allows me to be an elitist South Indian,
doling out free advice (being an IITian is the icing on the cake). Being brought up in North India allows me
to enjoy Yo Yo Honey Singh without any baggage.<br/><br/>
Oh, and I like running - in theory and cracking nerd jokes; and travelling. (Be warned, self-aggrandization ahead!)<br>
