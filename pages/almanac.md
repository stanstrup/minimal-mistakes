## Software
I was introduced to the world of open source in college and I've never looked back.
Here's a list of some tools I can't live without:

- [antigen-hs](https://github.com/srijanshetty/antigen-hs): as git-submodules are a nightmare.
- [pushbullet](https://pushbullet.com): universal copy paste across devices, need I say more?
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): generic commandline fuzzyfinder.
- [tmux](https://github.com/srijanshetty/vcsh-tmux): terminal multiplexer.
- [vcsh and mr](/technical/vcsh-mr-dotfiles-nirvana/): dotfiles nirvana.
- [vim](https://github.com/srijanshetty/vim-plug/): cause every other editor feels half baked.
- [zsh](https://github.com/srijanshetty/zsh): Instantly Awesome ZSH using [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto).

**Media organization**<br/><br/>
I'm an obsessive compulsive, and I've dedicated my life to sorting my <strike>shit</strike>  media.

- [anki](http://ankisrs.net/): powerful, intelligent flashcards.
- [beets](beets.readthedocs.org): the music geek's media organizer.
- [boom](http://zachholman.com/boom/): bookmarks on the command line.
- [geeknote](http://www.geeknote.me/): cross-platform command line *Evernote* client.
- git: as Torvalds says *source control as the way it should be*.
- [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/): for everything else.
- [google photos](https://photos.google.com): Google scored a homerun with this one.
- [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is): annotate the web
- [ledger](http://www.ledger-cli.org/): powerful, double-entry accounting system.
- [memo](http://www.getmemo.org/): commandline note-taking.
- [snips](https://github.com/srijanshetty/snips): commandline snippets.

**Miscellaneous**<br/><br/>
An assorted list of other utilities that come in handy.

- [btsync](http://www.getsync.com/download): BitTorrent Sync.
- [vagrant](https://vagrantup.com): Reproducible dev environments.
- [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/): PDF Viewer.

## Media

Until I make a better section, [Trakt.tv](http://trakt.tv/users/srijanshetty) and [LastFM](http://www.last.fm/user/srijanshetty/tracks).

## Books
I've only recently started tracking the books on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/srijanshetty) which I've read or I intend to read; and through this endeavour, I've come to the arguably depressing conclusion that I don't read as much I'd like to. I've decided not to burden myself with realization and find solace in the fact that I consume a lot of blogs daily.<br><br>
**RSS**<br>
I read RSS on [Digg](digg.com/reader) (for-it-matters-which-RSS-reader-you-use).<br><br>
**Hypothes.is**<br>
I'm trying to do my bit in organizing the vast expanses of the internet using [hypothes.is](hypothes.is). You can access my annotation stream [here](hpothes.is/stream?=user:srijanshetty). It contains all articles that I found to be interesting.<br><br>
**Lectures & Papers**<br>
[Lectures](https://github.com/srijanshetty/lectures) and [Research Papers](https://github.com/srijanshetty/papers), that I found to be insightful.
